This my stuff; she hold. Repositorio CV Multimedia

Aquí es respondrà a les preguntes que hi havia per fer, seguit d'explicacions de com ha estat fet el diseny i tal:
• Project analysis:
  o Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she expecting to find in your project?
        Lets say that the final user is Laura García, whose occupation is a HR recruiter at a tech company. She wants to find qualified candidates for junior web development roles, review portfolio projects to assess the candidate qualities. She appreciates when candidates showcase both technical and creative abilities. She expects to be able to identify clearly which kind of tools the candidate is able to use in order to qualify          for the role, or his recognitions if he is somewhat more capable of doing more things and of course, the experience the candidate has from other jobs he may have applied.
  
o Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis is basically the distribution of the different sections of the CV on the pageo Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography? Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects. Describe using around 200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the page's information.

The main idea was to display information in 2 columns, one for more common/regular information and the other for more "Quality-like" information as per experience or recognitions plus education. Of course a photo of the candidate(just want to say that since I didnt upload a photo of me, I did put one as if it was a prototype, please, dont take it into account the image, just imagine that there is actually someone there, thanks) to see who the final user will be contracting. Mail, phone and location as per usual is key information. Following next, some knowledge that the candidate has obtained, plus some other information like languages, social media and hobbies to display capabilities and the portfolio in GitHub (very important of course). Then on the right you can see the actual important information pertaining to the experience of the candidate, which is the main information that someone who is contracting should look up.



Visual design: describe using around 200 words (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.

As per the colors, I liked a somewhat dark blue-ish with light blue which I believe it provides some clean and modern look. About typography, just the first that I thought it looked clean. Main thing that will catch your glance will be the left and right column. I thought that an idea to somewhat dive deep into the computer engineering focus was to display some more ability and so an animation related with technology. So using some websites to consult and extended my knowledge about how to do animations, the animation that you see was able to be born. It wasnt that bad, more difficult was how to find a way to make the "circuit" go for all the website, from top to bottom. Then putting some little icons next to some words for a fast recognition of information plus 2 little "surprises" or secrets hidden in the file so you can see that I had some abilities to be able to display more knowledge about my HTML and CSS (when mouse is over VideoGames, a photo will be displayed and while hovering over Music, an audio of music will sound. It takes like 10 seconds to properly load, so after that time, hovering should activate) which I thought it was a little touch and cool to see. Also some links on the Social Media section that will open a new Tab directed to that social media account.
